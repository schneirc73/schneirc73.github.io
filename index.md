### Classification Projects 

[Health Care Worker Attrition](https://github.com/schneirc73/Healthcare_Attrition_Prediction)


<img src="images/HTurnover_Feature.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/H_Turnover_Classifier.png?raw=true"/>

This classifier is able to predicit if a healthcare worker quit their current job.  A healthcare provider can tweak this project to determine if an employee(s) are in the quiting threshold and take appropriate action to mitgate the risk of losing an employee(s).  Currently the Ada Boost Classifier used performed with an accuracy of 94% on the test data.

[Fish Image Classification](https://github.com/schneirc73/Fish_Classifier_POC)

<img src="images/Fish_Training.png?raw=true"/>

This classifier is able to predict what type of fish is being shown.  The classifier has 9 distinct categories with a 95% accuracy score on the test data by utilizing a convolutional neural network.

[Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/schneirc73/Stroke_Prediction_Python/tree/main)

<img src="images/Stroke Status.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/Stroke_Confusion.png?raw=true"/>

This classifier is able to predict if a patient is likley to experience a stroke based current attributes.  Using a grid searched SVM classifier the model performed with 95.2% accurarcy on the test data.
